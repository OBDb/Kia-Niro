    description: "The original Kia Niro was introduced as the brand's first dedicated hybrid crossover, designed from the ground up to accommodate electrified powertrains. Featuring a subtle crossover design with conservative styling, it prioritized efficiency over rugged SUV aesthetics. Built on a platform shared with the Hyundai Ioniq, it was available with three powertrain options: hybrid (HEV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and fully electric (EV) variants added later. The hybrid combined a 1.6L GDI four-cylinder engine with an electric motor for a combined 139 HP, paired with a six-speed dual-clutch transmission rather than the CVT typical of many hybrids. The PHEV added a larger battery for approximately 26 miles of electric-only range, while the EV offered around 239 miles of range from its 64 kWh battery. The interior featured a straightforward design with a focus on practicality and technology, including available features like an 8-inch touchscreen, wireless phone charging, and advanced driver assistance systems. Despite its crossover positioning, the first-generation Niro was only available with front-wheel drive. This generation established the Niro as a practical, efficiency-focused vehicle that combined crossover utility with hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or electric efficiencyâ€”offering customers a choice of electrification levels in a similar package."

    description: "The current Niro features dramatically more distinctive styling inspired by the 2019 HabaNiro concept, with a bold two-tone design incorporating a contrasting 'Aero Blade' C-pillar, angular 'heartbeat' LED daytime running lights, and a more assertive front end. Still offered in hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fully electric variants, it maintains its position as Kia's multi-powertrain eco-focused crossover. The hybrid and PHEV continue with an updated version of the 1.6L GDI engine and six-speed dual-clutch transmission, with combined system outputs of 139 HP and 180 HP respectively. The PHEV now offers approximately 33 miles of electric range from its larger 11.1 kWh battery. The Niro EV features a 64.8 kWh battery with around 253 miles of range and 201 HP from its electric motor. The interior represents a major advancement with a curved display combining a 10.25-inch digital instrument cluster and 10.25-inch infotainment touchscreen, ambient lighting, and sustainable materials including recycled wallpaper headliner and seat upholstery made from eucalyptus leaves. New technology includes Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) functionality in the EV model allowing it to power external devices, and an expanded suite of driver assistance features. Slightly larger than its predecessor in all dimensions, it offers improved passenger and cargo space while maintaining its urban-friendly footprint. This generation elevates the Niro's design and technology while continuing to offer customers their choice of electrification level, making it a versatile option in Kia's increasingly electrified lineup."
